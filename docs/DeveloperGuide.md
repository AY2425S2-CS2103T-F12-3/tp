## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [ `Main` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [ `MainApp` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [ `Ui.java` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [ `MainWindow` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [ `MainWindow.fxml` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API**: [ `Logic.java` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>
**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a guest).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.

### Model component

**API**: [ `Model.java` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Wedding` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueWeddingList` object). Each `Wedding` object represents a wedding stored inside WeddingHero.
  * each `Wedding` object, in turn, stores the data about that wedding i.e., all `Table` objects 'used' for the wedding(which are contained in a `UniqueTableList` object), and all `Person` objects 'invited' to the wedding (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Wedding` object that will be displayed and manipulated by the GUI
* stores the `UniqueTableList` and `UniquePersonListof`  the currently 'selected' `Wedding` to be displayed on the GUI
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

### Storage component

**API**: [ `Storage.java` ](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### `createWedding` Command

The `createWedding`  allows a user to create a new wedding to be stored inside the system.

It should be noted that this command does not automatically set the wedding created by the command as the current wedding displayed in the GUI. The user could do that by using the `setWedding` command after the wedding has been created.

The implementation involves the following validation steps:
- Checking that the input format is correct
- Checking that another wedding with the same name does not already exist in the system

Once all conditions are met, a new wedding is created, and the user can then set this wedding to be the current wedding before adding guests and tables to this wedding.

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command

<puml src="diagrams/CreateWeddingActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="Activity diagram for createWedding command" />

This command is useful for creating a new wedding to keep track of if the user has to manage another wedding.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `setWedding` Command

The `setWedding`  allows a user to set a wedding as the 'current' wedding to display in the GUI and manipulate the data of.

The implementation involves the following validation steps:
- Checking that the input format is correct
- Checking that the wedding with the given name exists

Once all conditions are met, the wedding with the given name is retrieved and is set as the 'current' wedding to be displayed in the GUI and to have its `person` and `table` data manipulated on.

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command

<puml src="diagrams/SetWeddingActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="Activity diagram for setWedding command" />

This command is useful for choosing which wedding the user wants to see and edit using the GUI.

**System Behavior:**
- The active wedding setting is not preserved between application sessions.
- When the application is restarted, no wedding is set as active.
- Users must explicitly set their working wedding after each application launch.

**Design Rationale:**
- The active wedding setting is designed for the current session only.
- This design choice provides several benefits:
    1. **Explicit Context**: Users must consciously choose which wedding they want to work with at the start of each session.
    2. **Safety**: Prevents accidental modifications to the wrong wedding by requiring explicit selection.
    3. **Clarity**: Ensures users are always aware of which wedding they are currently viewing and modifying.
    4. **Fresh Start**: Each session begins with a clean slate, reducing the chance of confusion from previous sessions.
    5. **Intentional Workflow**: Encourages users to be deliberate about which wedding they are working on.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `weddingOverview` Command

The `weddingOverview`  allows a user to get a quick overview of the currently selected wedding.

It provides the user with the number of tables used for the current wedding and the number of persons invited to the current wedding. It also provides a list of the persons invited to the current wedding along with their details.

The implementation involves the following validation steps:
- Checking that the input format is correct
- Checking that there is a currently selected wedding displayed in the GUI

Once all conditions are met, all of the persons invited to the wedding and all of the tables used in the wedding are displayed in the GUI, and the aforementioned overview information of the current wedding is shown in the area below the user input.

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command

<puml src="diagrams/WeddingOverviewActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="Activity diagram for weddingOverview command" />

This command is useful for getting a quick overview of the currently set wedding.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `deleteWedding` Command

The `deleteWedding`  allows a user to delete a wedding that has been previously stored from the system.

The implementation involves the following validation steps:
- Checking that the input format is correct
- Checking that the wedding with the given name exists

Once all conditions are met, the wedding with the given name is deleted from the system.
If the wedding to be deleted is also the 'current' wedding and is being displayed on the GUI, then the GUI is cleared to show no information.

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteWeddingActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="Activity diagram for deleteWedding command" />

This command is useful when a wedding has already happened and no longer needs to be managed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `addPerson` Command

The `addPerson` command allows a user to add a guest to the currently active wedding's guest list. This command is essential for wedding planners to build and manage their client's guest list.

The implementation involves several key steps and validation checks:

1. The command creates a new `Person` object with the provided details (name, phone, email, tags, address, dietary restrictions, and RSVP status)
2. It then attempts to add this person to the current wedding through the model
3. The implementation includes the following validation checks:
   - Verifying that there is a current wedding set (throws `NoCurrentWeddingException` if not)
   - Ensuring the person is not already in the guest list (throws `DuplicatePersonException` if duplicate found)
4. If successful, it returns a success message with the person's details
5. If an exception is caught, it provides appropriate error feedback to the user

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `addPerson` command is processed:

<puml src="diagrams/AddPersonActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for AddPerson Command" />

This command follows the Command pattern, where the `AddPersonCommand` encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests and queue or log requests.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `deletePerson` Command

The `deletePerson` command allows users to remove a guest from the currently active wedding's guest list using their displayed index number.

The implementation involves several key steps and validation checks:

1. The command takes an index parameter to identify which person to delete
2. It retrieves the list of currently displayed persons from the model
3. The implementation includes the following validation checks:
   - Verifying that there is a current wedding set
   - Ensuring the provided index is within valid bounds of the displayed list
4. If the index is valid, it retrieves the person at that index and removes them from the wedding
5. If the person was assigned to a table, they are also removed from that table
6. A success message is returned with details of the deleted person

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command:

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePersonActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram for DeletePerson Command" />

This command supports the need for wedding planners to be able to update guest lists as clients make changes to their wedding plans.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `filterPersons` Command

The `filterPersons` command allows users to filter the guest list based on dietary restrictions and/or RSVP status. This feature is particularly useful for wedding planners who need to quickly identify specific groups of guests, such as those with special dietary needs or those who have not yet responded to invitations.

The implementation involves several key steps and validation checks:

1. The command can accept one or both filter types: dietary restrictions (d/) and RSVP status (r/)
2. It validates that at least one filter type is specified and prevents multiple filters of the same type
3. It creates the appropriate filter objects based on the specified criteria
4. For cases where both dietary restriction and RSVP filters are specified, it combines them using a logical AND operation
5. It then applies the combined filter to the guest list in the model
6. Finally, it returns a result message showing the number of persons who matched the filter criteria

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterPersonsActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram for FilterPersons Command" />

This filtering functionality helps wedding planners efficiently organize guests by important attributes, allowing for better catering planning and follow-up on outstanding RSVPs.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `addPersonToTable` Command

The `addPersonToTable`  allows a user to assign a specific guest to a specific table within the currently active wedding.

The implementation involves several validation steps:
- Checking that the input format is correct
- Checking that the specified person exists in the current guest list
- Checking that the table exists
- Ensuring the table has available capacity

Once all conditions are met, the guest is assigned to the table and the system state is saved.

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command

<puml src="diagrams/AddPersonToTableActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="Activity diagram for addPersonToTable command" />

This command is useful when the seating arrangement has been decided and guests need to be assigned to a table.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### `deletePersonFromTable` Command

The `deletePersonFromTable` command allows users to remove a person from their assigned table in the currently active wedding. This feature helps wedding planners manage seating arrangements efficiently when plans change.

The implementation involves several key steps and validation checks:

1. The command takes two required parameters: the guest's name and the table ID
2. It first validates that there is a current wedding set
3. It then checks that the specified person exists in the wedding's guest list
4. Next, it verifies that the table with the given ID exists
5. It also confirms that the person is actually seated at the specified table
6. If all validations pass, the person is removed from the table and their table assignment status is updated
7. Finally, a success message is displayed, confirming that the guest has been removed from the specified table

The activity diagram below illustrates the control flow of this command:

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePersonFromTableActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram for DeletePersonFromTable Command" />

This command is useful when guests need to be reassigned to different tables or when a guest cancels their attendance but the planner wishes to retain their information in the guest list without a table assignment.

  1. If the app hangs due to corrupted data file, close the app
  2. Locate the /data directory in the same directory as the app
  3. Go inside the /data directory and locate weddinghero.json
  4. Delete the weddinghero.json file
  5. Restart the app

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Make setWedding error message more specific:** We currently don't have a feature where users can't directly access all of the names of the weddings they've created so far. The current error message for not entering an existing wedding's name for the `setWedding` command shows `There is no wedding with the name: ` with the typed wedding name. We plan to make this error message also mention all the names of currently created weddings so that the users can see which weddings they've created so far.
