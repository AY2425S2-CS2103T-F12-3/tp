# Project Portfolio Presentation (PPP)

## Overview
We developed [WeddingHero](#https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-f12-3.github.io/tp/index.html), a user-friendly wedding 
management application designed to streamline the wedding planning process. With both a robust Command Line 
Interface (CLI) and an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI), WeddingHero enables wedding planners to efficiently 
manage multiple weddings, coordinate guest lists, seating arrangements, dietary restrictions, and RSVP tracking.

I specifically implemented the `filterPersonCommand` along with its supporting filters and command parser, ensuring 
comprehensive testing and seamless integration into the overall system.

## Summary of Contributions

### Code Contributions
- **Key Implementations:**
  - **filterPersonCommand:** Developed the command to filter persons based on various criteria.
  - **Filters Implemented:**
    - **DietaryFilter:** Allows filtering of persons based on dietary preferences.
    - **RSVPFilter:** Filters persons according to their RSVP status (arguments required for this filter).
  - **FilterCommandParser:** Created the parser to handle and process filtering commands.
  - **Testing:** Wrote comprehensive tests to ensure robustness and correctness of all filtering functionalities.

### Contributions to the User Guide (UG)
- **UG Enhancements:**
  - Took a lead role in writing out most of the command sections.
  - Ensured the table of contents was formatted neatly.
  - Revised the summary of tables to provide a clear and concise overview of commands.
  - Verified and fixed hyperlinks, ensuring they worked properly.
  - Influenced the overall structure and content of the User Guide.

### Contributions to the Developer Guide (DG)
- **DG Enhancements:**
  - Contributed significantly to the content and structure of the Developer Guide.
  - Updated and refined UML diagrams and command descriptions to better reflect system architecture.

### Team-Based Contributions
- **Collaborative Efforts:**
  - Assisted team members by identifying bugs and offering solutions.
  - Created and raised issues constructively during team meetings.
  - Managed all team releases by ensuring code quality and thorough testing before pull requests.
  - Acted as an instrumental team player by offering help, suggestions, and timely feedback on peers' code.
  - **Resolved Numerous GitHub Issues:**  
    - Fixed issues related to unsupported prefixes, filters, ranging from minor to major bugs and more, including:  
      - #256, #252, #254, #244, #198, #190, #186, #257, #255, #199, #192, #194, #193, #216, #220...
