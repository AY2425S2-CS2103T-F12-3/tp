**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be typed in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `deleteGuest [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `deleteGuest [n/NAME]` or `deleteGuest [p/PHONE_NUMBER]`
