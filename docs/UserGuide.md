## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed
   [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).<br>
   **Window and Linux users:** can find their Java `17` download links
   [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/WeddingHero-level3/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your WeddingHero.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar WeddingHero.jar`
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   
<img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" style="max-width: 75%; height: auto;" />


5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
- `addPerson n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/None r/YES` : Adds a person named John Doe with RSVP status and dietary preference to the active wedding.
- `createWedding n/Jack and Jill's Wedding` : Creates a new wedding called "Jack and Jill's Wedding". 
- `exit` : Exits the application.


- Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- **Words in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders for user input.**  
  For example, in `add n/NAME`, you can use:  
  `add n/John Doe` (where `John Doe` replaces `NAME`).

- **Prefixes** (e.g., `n/`, `p/`, `e/`) **must be used exactly as shown**, including lowercase letters and the slash.  
  Missing or mistyped prefixes will result in an invalid command.

- **Parameters can be typed in any order.**  For example, `n/John p/91234567` and `p/91234567 n/John` are both valid.

- **Commands are case-sensitive for field values** where applicable, such as `d/VEGAN` vs. `d/vegan`.

- **Optional parameters are shown in square brackets.**  
  e.g., `filterPersons [d/DietaryRestriction] [r/RSVP]`.

## Using Wedding Hero

### Getting Help

You can access a help popup at any time while using Wedding Hero.
<img src="images/helpMessage.png" alt="help message" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto;" />


### Viewing Help: `help`

Displays a message that explains how to access the full user guide.

**Format:**

help
```
## How Wedding Hero Works (System Flow)

Wedding Hero helps you manage **multiple weddings** with ease by using a **“set and operate” model**:

1. **Create a wedding** using the `createWedding` command.
2. **Set the wedding as active** using the `setWedding` command.
3. Once a wedding is set as active, all operations like adding persons, tables, or assigning seats apply **only to that 
   active wedding**.
4. You can view and manage each wedding’s persons, tables, and RSVP details independently.

>  **Note:** You can only interact with one wedding at a time. You must `setWedding` before performing most other 
> commands (e.g., `addPerson`, `addTable`, etc.).

---

### Typical Workflow Example

Here's a typical command sequence you might use a wedding planner:

```
createWedding n/John & Jane Wedding
setWedding John & Jane Wedding
addPerson n/John p/91234567 e/john@example.com a/123 Street d/None r/YES
addTable tid/1 c/10
addPersonToTable n/John tid/1
weddingOverview
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features

### Managing Weddings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Creating a Wedding : `createWedding`

Creates a new wedding in the wedding planner.

**Format:**
`createWedding n/WEDDINGNAME`

- Creates a wedding with the provided `n/WEDDINGNAME`.
- The parameter `n/WEDDINGNAME` should be a valid string representing the name of the wedding. Feel free to use spaces.
- This command is used to quickly add a new wedding event to the system.

**Examples:**
- Running `createWedding John & Jane Wedding` will create a wedding entry with the name "John & Jane Wedding".
- Using `createWedding Smith Family Wedding` will add a wedding event named "Smith Family Wedding".

<box type="tip" seamless>
- After using createWedding, remember to set the wedding as active using:
  setWedding John & Jane Wedding
- Always match spacing exactly when setting or referring to a wedding — "John&JaneWedding" is not the same as "John & Jane Wedding".
- Once a wedding is set, any added persons, tables, or edits will apply to that active wedding.
</box>

### Setting a Wedding : `setWedding`

Sets a specific wedding as the active wedding, enabling modifications such as editing person lists and other wedding
details.

**Format:**
```
setWedding WEDDINGNAME
```

- Sets the active wedding context to the wedding with the provided **`WEDDINGNAME`**.
- Activates a previously created wedding identified by WEDDINGNAME.
  -Once set, all person and table operations will apply to this active wedding.
  -The WEDDINGNAME must match the name used during createWedding, with correct spacing.


**Examples:**
- Running `setWedding John & Jane Wedding` sets the active wedding to "John & Jane Wedding".
- Using `setWedding Smith Wedding` sets the active wedding to the wedding named "Smith Wedding".


  <box type="info" seamless> Note: You can only modify or view wedding details after setting a wedding as active. </box>

### Wedding Overview : `weddingOverview`

Provides an overview of the current active wedding, including details such as the number of tables and persons.

**Format:**
```
weddingOverview
```

- Retrieves a summary overview of the active wedding.
- No additional arguments are required.
- The overview includes key details such as the number of tables and persons and the list of persons invited.

**Examples:**
- Running `weddingOverview` after setting an active wedding displays the wedding's summary details.

### Deleting a Wedding : `deleteWedding`


Deletes a wedding from the system by name.

**Format:**
```
deleteWedding WEDDINGNAME
```

- Permanently deletes the wedding identified by WEDDINGNAME.
- WEDDINGNAME must match the exact name of the wedding you created. The comparison is case-insensitive but spacing must match exactly.
- Once deleted, all associated persons, tables, and data under the wedding will also be removed.

Examples:
- deleteWedding John & Jane Wedding would delete John & Jane Wedding

<box type="warning" seamless>  This action is irreversible. Ensure you are deleting the correct wedding before confirming. </box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Managing People

### Adding a person: `addPerson`

Adds a person to the currently active wedding’s person list.

**Format:**
```
addPerson n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS d/DIETARY_RESTRICTION r/RSVP
```
Details:

All fields are mandatory and must follow the exact format.

Each prefix represents a specific attribute of the person:
- n/ → Full name (e.g., John Doe)
- p/ → Phone number (e.g., 12345678)
- e/ → Email address (e.g., johndoe@example.com)
- a/ → Address (e.g., 123 Street)
- d/ → Dietary Restriction (must be selected from approved list below)
- r/ → RSVP status (YES or NO, NO_RESPONSE)


<box type="tip" seamless> Refer to the dietary restriction section below to see the full list of dietary restrictions to choose from.
</box>


Allowed d/DIETARY_RESTRICTION values:
- NONE
- VEGETARIAN
- VEGAN
- HALAL
- SHELLFISH
- PEANUTS
- EGGS
- FISH
- SOY
- SESMAE

Allowed RSVP values:
- YES
- NO
- NO_RESPONSE (if not yet responded)
  **Examples:**
```
addPerson n/John Doe p/12345678 e/johndoe@example.com a/123 Street d/NONE r/YES
addPerson n/Alex Tan p/87654321 e/alex@example.com a/456 Avenue d/VEGAN r/NO
```
- A wedding should be set before a person can be added.

### Deleting a Person : `deletePerson`

Deletes a person from the currently active wedding's person list, using their displayed index number.

**Format:**
```
deletePerson INDEX
```
Details:
INDEX: A positive integer corresponding to the person's number in the displayed person list.
(e.g., from a previous list or filterPersons command)

- You must run setWedding before this command — deletion only works for persons in the currently active wedding.
- If the index is invalid or out of range, the system will show an error.
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

```
deletePerson 1     // Deletes the first person shown in the list
deletePerson 3     // Deletes the third person shown in the list
```
<box type="warning" seamless> Make sure you're viewing the correct list of persons before deleting — the index is 
based on the currently displayed list. </box>


### Filtering Persons: `filterPersons`

This command allows you to filter your list of persons by applying dietary restriction and/or RSVP status filters.
You can use it to display only those persons who meet the criteria you specify.

**Format:**
```
filterPersons [d/DIETARYRESTRICTION] [r/RSVP]
```
- Both parameters are optional for this command.
- Note that you can only key in one of each parameter for this command.
- Using invalid prefixes such as `n/NAME` will be treated as `filterPersons` as if no prefixes are given 
- **Dietary Restriction Filter:** Use the prefix `d/` followed by a valid dietary restriction value
  (e.g., `VEGAN`, `VEGETARIAN`). Include this if you want to filter persons based on dietary needs.
- **RSVP Filter:** Use the prefix `r/` followed by a valid RSVP status (e.g., `YES`, `NO`).
  Include this if you want to filter persons by their RSVP response.

You can provide one or both filters to narrow down your list. If no filters are specified,
the command returns an unfiltered list of persons belonging to that wedding.

<img src="images/UG-example-images/filterPersonExample.png" alt="List of filtered persons based on RSVP - No" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto;" />

<sub>Example output when filtering persons based on RSVP `NO` using command: `filterPersons r/NO`</sub>

**Examples:**
- Running `filterPersons d/VEGAN r/YES` displays all persons who are vegan and have accepted the invitation.
- Using `filterPersons d/HALAL` displays all persons with a halal dietary restriction.
- Running `filterPersons` displays all persons without any filter.

## Managing Tables

**Format:**
```
addTable tid/TABLEID c/CAPACITY
```

### Saving the data

WeddingHero data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to
save manually.

### Editing the data file

WeddingHero data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/WeddingHero.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.
<box type="warning" seamless><br>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, WeddingHero will discard all data and start with an
empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the WeddingHero to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside
the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous WeddingHero home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Known issues
1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the application before running the application again.
2. If you minimize the Help Window and then run the help command (or use the Help menu, or the keyboard shortcut F1) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
